# JAV Sorter
This web-based tool was created after getting frustrated by Javinizer which results were getting more unreliable by the day.

## Features
- JAV metadata scraping from various sites including DMM, MGStage, FC2, ...
- Same jvThumbs.csv as Javinizer.
- jvThumbs.csv is updated each time a new actress info is found or has a new alias.

## Limitations
- Contrary to Javinizer, this was created with my own use case in mind, and is pretty much not customizable.
- Neither automated nor CLI-based sorting.

## Prerequisites
- Node 22
- A browser that can be used by Puppeteer (e.g. Chrome)
